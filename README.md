# Hakim Application (Still under development)

Hakim is a desktop application designed to manage a doctor's patients' files, appointments, and folders, among other tasks. The application is built using WinUI 3 and follows the MVVM architecture, and it is connected to an SQLite database. This project is a side project to help my brother-in-law in his work.

## Features

- **Patient Management**: Easily add, edit, and delete patient records.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Schedule, view, and manage appointments.
- **Folder Management**: Organize and manage patient folders efficiently.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly search for patients and appointments.
- **Data Storage**: Securely store data in an SQLite database.

## Technologies Used

- **WinUI 3**: A modern UI framework for building Windows applications.
